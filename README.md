This repository is a collection of modules intending to help bootstrap an Android Application.
There are 4 modules:

1. Core: A module that hosts classes related to ```Activities```, ```Fragments``` and other ```Android``` core components.
2. View: A module containing UI building blocks, like animators and helper methods for views.
3. RecyclerView: Utility classes for the ```RecyclerView``` ```ViewGroup``` like drag and drop, swipe gestures, endless scrolling and much more.
4. ConstraintLayout: Utility classes for the ```ConstraintLayout``` ```ViewGroup```.
5. Material: Utility classes around Google's Material Design components including an expandable floating action button.
6. Communications: Utility classes for Near Service Discovery (NSD) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.
7. Test: Testing utilities built mostly around Espresso.
