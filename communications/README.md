## Bluetooth

Mostly copies of utilities introduced in newer versions of Android that make Bluetooth low energy a lot easier to work with.

1. `BleScanner`: Searches for compatible BLE devices.

2. `ScanFilterCompat`: Filters searches for BLE devices via defined criteria.

3. `ScanRecordCompat`: Summary of advetisement data from a BLE scan

5. `ScanResultCompat`: Results of a BLE scan.

## NSD

Utilities around Android's Near Service Discovery API, I typically use this for my IOT experiments.

1. `NsdHelper`: Class providing a wrapper around the NsdManager and provides convenience methods for setting up or searching for an NSD service.
